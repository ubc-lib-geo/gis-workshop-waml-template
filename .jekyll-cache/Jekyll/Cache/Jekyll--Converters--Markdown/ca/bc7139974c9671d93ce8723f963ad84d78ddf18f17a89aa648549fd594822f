<p>Before beginning the workshop, weâ€™d like to acknowledge the indigenous lands where we are located.</p>

<p>Phil is located on the territories of the NÃºu-agha-tÊ‰vÊ‰-pÊ‰Ì± (Ute), Cheyenne, Arapahoe, and OÄhÃ©thi Å akÃ³wiÅ‹ (Sioux) peoples. 48 contemporary tribal nations are historically tied to the lands that make up Colorado.</p>

<p>Evan is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xÊ·mÉ™Î¸kÊ·É™yÌ“É™m (Musqueam), sÉ™lÌ“ilwÉ™taÉÉ¬ tÉ™mÉ™xÊ· (Tsleil-Waututh), Stzâ€™uminus, Sâ€™Ã³lh TÃ©mÃ©xw (StÃ³:loÌ„), SkwxwÃº7mesh-ulh TemÃ­xÌ±w (Squamish), and Coast Salish peoples.</p>

<p>Since all of you are spread around the continent, letâ€™s take a moment to explore <a href="https://native-land.ca/">native-lands.ca</a> so that you can visualize the indigenous territories, languages, and treaties in your area.</p>

<p>We feel it is especially important for those of us who work with spatial and geographic information to understand the diverse histories of the lands we find ourselves. We ask that as you participate in WAML 2020, take a moment now and then to think about indigenous histories, territories, and knowledge systems in the context of of GIS, map-making, governance, and other topics that come up in conference sessions and discussions.</p>
